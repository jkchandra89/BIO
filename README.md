# BIO Hello, My Name is John Chandra ðŸ‘‹

I am a Seneca College Computer Programming CPP student leaning towards being a self-taught programmer. I have a background in Frontend development, having previously worked at the RBC Bank corporate building. Additionally, I have interned at TDSB and 680 News. I also contributed my skills to a privatized franchise of the grocery store The Giant Tiger, where I created an Ecommerce Website with User and Login Registration as well as a Shopping Cart using programming languages such as C, C++, HTML, CSS, and Javascript.

I'm a dedicated and hard-working individual with a passion for coding, currently honing my skills in various technologies. From frontend to backend, my expertise includes HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React.js, Node.js, and more.  I also have experience in finance and economics and possess strong leadership qualities, critical thinking, and hyper focus. Fluent in English, Italian, Spanish, French and Tamil. I have a working level knowledge of Hindi. I face obstacles in programming with my expert solutions that benefit everyone from users to creators.

ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently focusing on mastering MERN (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js) and Full Stack development to create a CRUD app, REST API, and a fusion clone of Udemy, Fiverr, and Upwork/Freelancer. This project is a vision I am working towards to bring to life someday, aiming to assist people globally through the dynamic landscape of programming. I am also in the early stages of launching my own remote startup...

ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m enthusiastic about collaborating and contributing to meaningful projects, as I believe in the value of giving back to the community...

ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m actively seeking guidance in enhancing my knowledge and skills in Algorithms and Data Structures to an expert level...

ðŸ’¬ Ask me about my journey in Frontend and Full-Stack, the diverse projects I have undertaken, and my aspirations for the future...

ðŸ’¬ In my spare time, my hobbies include traveling, reading mystery novels as well as other genres, aspiring to be an author some day in the thriller fiction world of books, car and home improvement, and writing resume's for others.

I am thrilled about the opportunity to be part of a team working on impactful projects and am eager to explore potential opportunities further. Thank you for taking the time to read about me.
